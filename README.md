HR Workforce Power BI Dashboard

Workforce Headcount Dashboard
The Workforce Headcount Dashboard is an insightful Power BI solution designed to help HR and business leaders monitor and analyze employee metrics across multiple dimensions. Using clean and structured data sourced from an Excel spreadsheet, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of organizational headcount trends, salary distribution, and employee demographics.

The dashboard tracks headcount growth over time, including the number of employees who joined each year. This allows stakeholders to identify hiring trends and workforce expansion phases. By leveraging time-based slicers, users can filter and drill into specific periods to analyze year-over-year changes in workforce size.

Another key component of the dashboard is the average salary analysis, broken down by qualification level and gender. This enables organizations to assess pay equity, benchmark compensation strategies, and ensure transparency across different employee groups. It also helps highlight disparities or gaps that may require further attention.

Additionally, the dashboard provides a detailed age distribution breakdown, showing how the workforce is segmented by age brackets. This demographic view assists in workforce planning, succession strategy, and identifying potential retirement waves. The integration of leave balance data further enriches the analysis, offering insights into total and average leave balances across employees. HR teams can use this information to monitor leave accrual, utilization trends, and potential burnout risks.
